## What
The repo contains a lib and a cli that uses tonic-build to generate rust-code from protobuf.  
[tonic-build](https://docs.rs/tonic-build/latest/tonic_build/) already does this, the cli is a front-end to 
that with some added code to make sure that the generated files are placed in a valid path, and takes care of the 
module structuring.

## Why
[prost-build](https://docs.rs/prost-build/latest/prost_build/) used to ship with `cmake` which we would like to avoid.  
`cmake` was used to build `protoc` which was then used for the proto-to-rust codegen.  
The final decision from the prost maintainers side is that the user should provide their own protoc and check in the code
instead of building it in a `build.rs`, to make that process simpler, this cli was created.
